# A Philosophy of Software Design

- The most fundamental problem in computer science is problem
decomposition: how to take a complex problem and divide it up into pieces that
can be solved independently. Problem decomposition is the central design task
that programmers face every day, and yet, other than the work described here, I
have not been able to identify a single class in any university where problem
decomposition is a central topic. We teach for loops and object-oriented
programming, but not software design.
