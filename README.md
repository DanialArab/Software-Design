# A Philosophy of Software Design

## Preface

- The most fundamental problem in computer science is problem
decomposition: how to take a complex problem and divide it up into pieces that
can be solved independently. Problem decomposition is the central design task
that programmers face every day, and yet, other than the work described here, I
have not been able to identify a single class in any university where problem
decomposition is a central topic. We teach for loops and object-oriented
programming, but not software design.

- Many people assume that software design skill is an innate talent that cannot be taught.
However, there is quite a bit of scientific evidence that outstanding performance
in many fields is related more to high-quality practice than innate ability (see, for
example, Talent is Overrated by Geoff Colvin).

- Related class taught by the author: CS 190 at Stanford University

- I recommend that you take the suggestions in this book with a grain of salt.
The overall goal is to reduce complexity; this is more important than any
particular principle or idea you read here. If you try an idea from this book and
find that it doesn’t actually reduce complexity, then don’t feel obligated to keep
using it (but, do let me know about your experience; I’d like to get feedback on
what works and what doesn’t).
